v0.02
* Fixed empty columns as extra proteins issue (#4)
* Improved logging messages
* Optimizations for very large datasets. Replaced some operations on python lists by their numpy equivalents to speed up calculation on larger datasets. Also, we now skip the posterior calculation for proteins with identification PEP = 1.0, since they will never be differentially abundant anyway.

v0.01.4
* Fixed windows multiprocessing error more elegantly (#2)
* Suppressed warnings from child processes (#3)

v0.01.3
* Fixed Windows multiprocessing error (#2)
* Added spectrum identifier to peptide output

v0.01.2
* Bumped numpy dependency to 1.12 for numpy.count_nonzero along axis
* Removed need for cond_idx:cond_name format for condition column
* Set --min_samples option to 2 instead of 1 and added check for --min_samples >= 2
* Added filter for entries with 0 or NaN intensity
* Added run dependent identification PEP for consensus spectra

v0.01.1
* Fixed dependency on qvality (#1)
* Changed to (slightly slower) 2D integration for in-group variance latent variable.

v0.01.0
* Initial release
